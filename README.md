## Simple project to load and display content
The project does the following:
- loads content from Contentful
- parses the content into categories
- article titles/categories are then displayed on the screen with the ability to select a category
- pressing on a card will open the article on a new screen and load the whole article to read

**sorry for the tab spacing... still getting things set up on my laptop**
